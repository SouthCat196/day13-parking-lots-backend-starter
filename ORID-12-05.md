**I:**

1. In today’s Agile development course, I realized that almost all the concepts have been practiced in PCO, which makes me increasingly appreciate the well-structured development process of PCO.
2. Although the result of our presentation wasn’t ideal, our team made a great effort to steer it in a positive direction. The process was highly efficient, and I noticed significant improvements compared to last week’s preparation.

1. During the retrospective, we summarized several areas that need improvement in the presentation: speech delivery, PPT design, and content preparation. These points must be addressed for the final showcase.
