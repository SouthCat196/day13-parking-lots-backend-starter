**I:**

1. Although I knew before that GenAI could assist in development, I didn’t have a favorable impression of such tools until today. My previous internship company used Cursor for coding assistance, but those tools weren’t very “smart” back then. Today, after trying GitHub Copilot for the first time, I realized that these tools have advanced to the point where they seem to “know what I want to do next.”
2. Proper techniques and prompts are essential when using GenAI tools to maximize their effectiveness. Otherwise, fixing errors in the generated code can be highly inefficient.

**D:**

1. Increase the use of GenAI tools in future work, accumulate prompt experience, and document commonly used prompts.
2. Prepare for tomorrow’s presentation.
